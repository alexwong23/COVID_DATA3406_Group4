# DATA3406 - Group 4 (Thurs 12B): 'Deadliness' of COVID-19 (Global and Country-Based)

This project is an inspection of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its perceived deadliness across the world. Analysis will be both from a holistic, global perspective, as well as close examination of certain countries and how they have been impacted by COVID-19.

Our analysis will also consider potential uncertainty present in the data provided.

The source of the data will be from *Our World in Data* (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

## Driving Question

The driving question of our analysis is *How Deadly is COVID-19?* We will be examining the 'deadliness' of COVID-19 both from a global perspective, as well as a select few countries and examining their responses to managing the virus.

We will also be accounting for the uncertainty that might be prevalent within the data sources, and we will be making sure to mention these when producing data visualisations.

## Background

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease that has impacted the world substantially. It has been classified as a global pandemic by the *World Health Organisation* (WHO), and has sparked countries across the world to develop management and prevention strategies such as lockdowns and extensive social distancing practices.

## Data Origin 

## Data Definitions 

Group Meeting Minutes - Minutes folder
Each group meeting minutes is stored in the Minutes folder with the format, Week#_Meeting_Minutes.pdf. Each document contains the agenda for the week and the following meeting. It also records the action items and division of work among group members for the following week. Additionally, it discusses the key points we learned from each member’s individual analysis.

Process Notebooks
Each group member has their own Jupyter notebook containing the data exploration for their respective part. These process notebooks are updated regularly and stored in the Process Notebooks folder.

### Ethics

## Contributing
(assuming you are currently on your local repository directory)
1. `$git pull` - pull the latest changes **(ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST)** 
2. Make your changes to the folder, either by adding a new file, or overwriting an existing file. 
3. `$git add .` - for add all changes or ‘$git add hello.ipynb’ - for a specific file.
4. `$git commit -m “Your commit comments here." `
5. `$git push` - push your commits to the repository.

If you thought you had made a mistake, you can simly reset your commit by using the command,
   * `$git reset --soft HEAD~1` to reset it back by 1 commit 
      * use `--soft` if you simply wanted to restructure your message.
      * use `--hard` if you want to completely remove the changes. 
   * `$git reset --hard 0abcd1d` resets to a specific commit based on the commit code.
