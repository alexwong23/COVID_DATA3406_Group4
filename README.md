# DATA3406 - Group 4 (Thurs 12B): 'Deadliness' of COVID-19 (Global and Country-Based)

This project is an inspection of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its perceived deadliness across the world. Analysis will be both from a holistic, global perspective, as well as close examination of certain countries and how they have been impacted by COVID-19.

Our analysis will also consider potential uncertainty present in the data provided.

The source of the data will be from *Our World in Data* (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

## Driving Question

The driving question of our analysis is *How Deadly is COVID-19?* We will be examining the 'deadliness' of COVID-19 both from a global perspective, as well as a select few countries and examining their responses to managing the virus.

We will also be accounting for the uncertainty that might be prevalent within the data sources, and we will be making sure to mention these when producing data visualisations.

## Background

It has been classified as a global pandemic by the *World Health Organisation* (WHO), and has sparked countries across the world to develop management and prevention strategies such as lockdowns and extensive social distancing practices.
